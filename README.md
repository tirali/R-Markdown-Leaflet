# R-Markdown-Leaflet
Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet
Coursera Developing Data Products Week 2 Peer-graded Assignment: Leaflet

In this project, we created a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet, representing the number of incoming passengers per station on the Parisian RATP railroad network in 2015.

The web page is published online on GitHub Pages.

The source data sets are not included in this repository. To reproduce this web page, you will need to download the following files and place them in a subdirectory named data:

positions-geographiques-des-stations-du-reseau-ratp.csv, from Positions géographiques des stations du réseau RATP (geographic position of stations on RATP network).

trafic-annuel-entrant-par-station-du-reseau-ferre-2015.csv, from Trafic annuel entrant par station du réseau ferré 2015 (annual traffic by station on railway network 2015).

traces-du-reseau-ferre-idf.csv, from Tracés du réseau de transport ferré d'Ile-de-France (layout of the Île-de-France railway network).
